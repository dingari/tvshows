# tvshows

This is a little python script I made to automate the extraction of tv shows automatically downloaded by ÂµTorrent's RSS downloader.

All you need is:
* A path to your rartool (winrar etc.)
* A regex of extensions to look for
* A source directory containing RSS downloaded files
* A destination directory to place files
